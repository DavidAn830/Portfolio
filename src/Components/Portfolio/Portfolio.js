              ExploreLearning Gizmos is the world’s largest library of
              interactive online simulations for math and science education in
              grades 3-12. Fun and easy to use, Gizmos help students develop a
              deep understanding of challenging concepts through inquiry and
              exploration. Students use Gizmos to interact with and explore
              hundreds of math and science topics ranging from heredity to
              trigonometry. Teachers use Gizmos as dynamic “what-if” tools to
              help students move beyond memorizing to true understanding. Each
              simulation is ideal for small group work, individual exploration,
              or whole class instruction using an LCD projector or interactive
              whiteboard. Assessment and reporting is also made easy with
              Gizmos. Students can immediately check their understanding and get
              helpful feedback after every Gizmo. Teachers can use real-time
              reporting of results to guide instructional decision making.
