            Hi, I am David An and I have 5 years of professional experience in
            front-end development. I also have an experience of dealing with
            back-end programming using Express and Node.js. I am proficient in
            JavaScript, CSS/CSS3/Scss, HTML/HTML5, React, and Java. I am also
            very familiar with modern front-end libraries such as Redux, React
            Router, jQuery, Axios and etc. Over the years of my professional
            experience, I achieved bachelor of science degree in computer
            science at James Madison University last year. I am excited for an
            opportunity to continue learning and develop my career.
